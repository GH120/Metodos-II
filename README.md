## Instalation
download the html and javascript files and put them in the same folder, running html is as simple as opening it in your browser

## Execution

Choose the function approximant you want to use for the integration (in this example, the trapezius formula)

Choose the integration bounds a and b (so that it integrates from a to b)

Choose the error precision (0.1 means that when it hits this level of uncertainty it stops running, lower levels like 0.001 means more precision)

Compute the function using javascript notation for formulas, x is given as the input variable being integrated

When all is done, hit the button "calcula!"
